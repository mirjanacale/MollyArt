* Check that the form can be submitted without filling out any of the fields.
* Check that pressing enter on a text input submits the form.
* Make sure there are no broken images or missing assets.
* Check responsiveness by resizing the browser window.
* Run tests on different devices/browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
