## Color

The color scheme for the project is a combination of  _#431313_ dark reddish-brown color and _#e6690a_ bright orange color. 
The color scheme for the website is a combination of soft and warm colors. The background is video.



## Navigation Bar

Users may navigate MollyArt's three pages with ease on any device because to the navigation bar's unifying design. It makes navigating between parts easier without requiring the use of the browser's back button by displaying the logo and links to the Home, Gallery, and Sign Up pages. Desktop users benefit from a traditional navigation bar that maximizes usability across all platforms, while mobile users may easily access content through a hamburger menu.

## The Footer 

Links to the MollyArt art studio's important social media pages can be found in the footer area.  The links will open in a new tab for the user's convenience in navigation.
The user benefits from the footer since it motivates them to maintain social media connections.

  ## Testing

  ### **Initial testing plan**

I started by creating a wireframe for my website and then I began coding in HTML, CSS. After that, I tested each :

* Check that all links in the navigation bar work correctly (Home, Gallery, SignUp).
* Check that the email field only accepts valid emails and does not accept invalid ones.
* Check that the form can be submitted without filling out any of the fields.
* Check that pressing enter on a text input submits the form.
* Make sure there are no broken images or missing assets.
* Check responsiveness by resizing the browser window.
* Run tests on different devices/browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
